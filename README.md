# Helpers

### A colection of general helpers

---

Helper functions for various uses, heavily inspired by [the Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework) helpers

I didn't want to import big libraries and packages<br/>
The intention is to keep my apps as slim and as close to clean php as possible<br/>
I got the idea from Zak Horton's [Slim 4 Authorization Tutorial ](https://github.com/zhorton34/authorize-slim-4) to create my own.<br/>

This package is part of a series of packages to create a modular skeleton ap for fast, lightweight simple application development<br/>
I wanted a self maintened "micro framework"<br/>
This series of repos also contains a mash of mixed ideas for classes, methods and aproaches I liked from [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel) and [Yii2](https://github.com/yiisoft).<br/>

It is free to use and modify as you see fit.<br/>
I recomend forking it because it's purpose is for personal use and I will only maintain it as long as I find it useful for myself.

It contains several functions split in categories
so far the categories are:

-   path helpers (several path shortcuts across the application)
-   string helpers (several string manipulation helper functions)
-   console helpers (CLI helper functions)
-   app helpers (helper functions for general use in the application)
