# Shared Library

### A collection of general helpers and commonly used classes

---

Helper functions for various uses, heavily inspired by [the Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework) helpers.

I didn't want to import big libraries and packages.<br/>
The intention is to keep my apps as slim and as close to clean PHP as possible.<br/>
I got the idea from Zak Horton's [Slim 4 Authorization Tutorial](https://github.com/zhorton34/authorize-slim-4) to create my own.<br/>

---

This package is part of a series of packages to create a modular skeleton app for fast, lightweight, simple application development.<br/>
I wanted a self-maintained "micro framework".<br/>
This series of repos also contains a mash of mixed ideas for classes, methods, and approaches I liked from [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel) and [Yii2](https://github.com/yiisoft).<br/>

---

It is free to use and modify as you see fit.<br/>
I recommend forking it because its purpose is for personal use and I will only maintain it as long as I find it useful for myself.
